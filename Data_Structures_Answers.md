Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) - Because it traverses every node in the tree.

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
   O(1) - Nothing is added.

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) - It traverses every node.

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?
   O(n) - Nodes get added to the queue.
